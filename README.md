# Graduation-Project

Here is the graduation project which i participated as a front-end developer other than researches and reports part.
I would be happy if i can share the codes. However, my friends did not give the permission.
So, i decided to upload our report here.
Section 4.1 in the report pdf explains some features in the web application.
This web application is built to support and ease admin activities for the actual mobile application.
Project is live at https://ens491admin.netlify.app
